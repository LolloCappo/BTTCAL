BTTCAL
==========

This repository contains open-source data and results from the National Research Project "Development of calibration procedures of Tip Timing systems for non-contact turbine blade vibration measurements". BTTCAL is funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR). Grant id is J53D23002440006 (PRIN2022).

-------------

The overarching goal of the project is to design and develop procedures and setup for calibrating Blade Tip-Timing Measurement Systems.
The Principal investigator is Prof. `Gianluca Rossi`_ from the Univeristy of Perugia, supported by:

- Prof. `Nicola Paone`_, Marche Polytechnic University
- Prof. `Roberto Montanini`_, University of Messina
- Prof. `Laura Fabbiano`_, Polytechnic of Bari
- dr. `Alessandro Schiavi`_, National Metrology Institute of Italy

Work-packages (WP)
--------
- WP1: Identification and quantification of parameters that influence measurement ucnertainty in BTT systems; designign and building a calibration setup.
- WP2: Calibration of optical-based sensors for BTT applications through an extensive experimental test camapaign
- WP3: Outreach, dissemination, and exploitation of the results
